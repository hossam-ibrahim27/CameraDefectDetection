## Camera Defect Detection Using Artificial Intelligence

### Project Overview
The rapid growth of industrial automation has increased the need for intelligent quality inspection systems capable of detecting manufacturing defects with high accuracy and speed. Traditional manual inspection methods are often time-consuming, inconsistent, and susceptible to human error.

This project proposes an Artificial Intelligence-based Camera Defect Detection System that utilizes Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques to automatically detect defects on manufactured products using industrial camera images. The system aims to improve production quality, reduce inspection time, minimize labor costs, and increase overall manufacturing efficiency.

The proposed solution employs state-of-the-art object detection algorithms such as YOLO12, image preprocessing techniques, and real-time inference to identify defective products during production.

### 1. Introduction
Quality control is one of the most important stages in manufacturing industries. Detecting defects at an early stage prevents defective products from reaching customers and reduces production losses.

Traditional inspection relies on human operators who may overlook small defects due to fatigue or environmental conditions.

Artificial Intelligence, especially Computer Vision, provides automated inspection systems capable of identifying defects accurately and consistently.

---

### 2. Problem Statement
Many factories still rely on manual visual inspection, which suffers from:
* Human errors
* Slow inspection speed
* High labor costs
* Inconsistent quality
* Difficulty detecting tiny defects

There is a need for an automated intelligent inspection system capable of detecting defects in real time.

### 3. Objectives
The project aims to:
* Build an automated defect detection system.
* Detect defective products using AI.
* Reduce inspection time.
* Improve production quality.
* Reduce manufacturing cost.
* Provide real-time monitoring.
* Generate inspection reports.

### 4. Key Project Steps

* **Step 1: Industrial Image Collection**  
  Gather high-resolution dataset images of manufactured products under varied lighting, angles, and surface conditions using industrial cameras.

* **Step 2: Defect Annotation & Labeling**  
  Annotate bounding boxes and assign precise fault classes (e.g., scratches, dents, cracks) using specialized labeling tools (Roboflow / Label Studio).

* **Step 3: Data Preprocessing & Augmentation**  
  Clean, resize, normalize images, and apply data augmentation techniques (rotation, contrast adjustments, noise injection) to expand training variance and prevent overfitting.

* **Step 4: YOLO12 Model Training**  
  Train the YOLO12 architecture on the annotated dataset leveraging GPU acceleration, hyperparameter tuning, and Area-Attention feature optimization.

* **Step 5: Validation & Model Performance Evaluation**  
  Evaluate detection metrics (mAP@50, mAP@50-95, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix) on unseen test sets to ensure high accuracy (>95%).

* **Step 6: Real-time Integration & Web Stream Testing**  
  Deploy the optimized weights (`.pt` / `.engine`) into a FastAPI backend and establish low-latency WebSocket communication for live browser camera feeds.

* **Step 7: Result Visualization & Alert Feedback Display**  
  Render detected defect bounding boxes, confidence scores, defect classification labels, and trigger status updates (`OK` / `Defect Detected`) on the React web dashboard in real time.
